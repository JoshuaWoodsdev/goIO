//1. Define the Core Functionalities

Decide on what specific tasks your file processor should perform. Examples might include:

    Counting the number of lines in a file.
    Searching for specific text or patterns.
    Converting file formats (e.g., from CSV to JSON).

2. Command-Line Arguments (os.Args)

Plan how users will interact with your program via the command line. Youâ€™ll need to handle:

    File path input.
    Possibly additional flags or commands for different operations.

Example usage:

    go run app.go /path/to/file.txt (basic usage to perform a default action)
    go run app.go /path/to/file.txt --count-lines (specific action like counting lines)

3. Reading the File

Decide on the method for reading files:

    Line by line: Useful for large files or when counting lines.
    Entire file at once: Better for smaller files or specific text searches.

4. Processing the Data

Based on your application's purpose, implement the logic to process the file data. This could involve:

    String operations.
    Regular expressions.
    Data structure manipulations.

5. Outputting the Results

Determine how the results should be presented:

    Print to console.
    Write to a new output file.
    Convert and save in a different format.

6. Error Handling

Plan robust error handling for scenarios like:

    File not found.
    Insufficient permissions.
    Invalid command usage.

7. Structuring the Code

Organize your code into functions for readability and maintainability. Possible functions:

    readFile()
    processFile()
    outputResults()
